This project is a Spring Boot application built to explore and experiment with Spring AI, integrating with Gemini (Googleâ€™s Generative AI) for intelligent conversational capabilities.

The goal of this project is to understand how to:

Configure and use Spring AI with external LLM providers like Gemini.

Build and expose REST APIs to interact with AI models.

Manage API keys securely using environment variables.

Develop a simple chat interface (frontend or API-based) to test real-time responses.
